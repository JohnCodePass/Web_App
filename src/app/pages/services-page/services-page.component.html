            <p class="mt-5" style="color:#004E99; font-size: 25px;">RTD launched its first Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
                Express Corridor in 2007, which has experienced extraordinary growth in ridership. Since then, RTD has
                launched four more BRT routes to accommodate our customersâ€™ demand for this high-quality service
                throughout the system, with Midtown Corridor and MLK Corridor in 2018 as the most recent additions. Over
                six miles each, these BRT Express routes are key corridors and critical components to building a better
                transportation system for the city of Stockton.</p>
            <p class="mt-5" style="color: #B61E8D; font-size: 45px;">What is BRT Express?</p> 
            <p style="color:#004E99; font-size: 25px;">BRT Express, a high-quality Bus Rapid Transit service, operates with fewer stops, off-board fare
                collection, and more frequent trips than regular bus service to make it fast, reliable, and
                convenient. To meet the demand for its most popular service, RTD also employs higher-capacity
                hybrid articulated buses.</p>
